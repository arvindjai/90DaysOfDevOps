**New day, New Topic.... Let's learn along ðŸ˜‰**
- Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. 
- Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
- Python has the following data types built-in by default: Numeric(Integer, complex, float), Sequential(string,lists, tuples), Boolean, Set, Dictionaries, etc

To check what is the data type of the variable used, we can simply write: ***type(variable)***

**Tasks**
1. Dig in more on Data types with examples. 
2. Difference between List, Tuple and set. Do Handson and put screenshots as per your understanding.
2. Here is a small task for you to extract your favourite Devops tool from below Dictionary:

Fav_Tool= {1:"Linux", 2:"Git", 3:"Docker", 4:"Kubernetes", 5:"Terraform", 6:"Ansible", 7:"Chef"}
[Hint: Use keys to print out the values of the dictionary]
