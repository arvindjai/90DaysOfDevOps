# Day 25 Task: Complete Jenkins CI/CD Project - Continued

  

I can imagine catching up will be tough so take a small breather today and complete the Jenkins CI/CD project from Day 24.

  

## Did you finish Day 24?

- Day 24 will give you an End to End project and adding it to your resume will be a cherry on the top
  
- take more time, finish the project and post about it today.
